**Identifying Caring Communities Within Dutch Chamber of Commerce Data: A Classifier Comparison**

For my Applied Data Science Master thesis I assesed various classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Tree).
I hyperparameter tuned and compared the performance of four classifiers regarding their ability to identify caring communities from Dutch Chamber of Commerce data.

In this repository you will find my thesis and the code I used to perform the experiment.

The data itself is not included due to privacy reasons.
